# Book Study: The Phoenix Project

## Section 3: Chapters 9-12

### *Themes*

### *Key Takeaways*

### *Discussion Questions*

#### Chapter 9
- Testing Day
  - Long testing process. Possibly next week before find out results.
  - If all goes well 7 weeks until changes are live in production. 2 weeks for QA 1, then another 2 weeks for QA 2, then 3 weeks for Ops to incorporate.
  - "Work is not fun and full of joy, like I know it should be. There is no flow of features, there is no feedback, and there certainly isn’t any learning..."
- throwing a party for QA
- QAs pain points
  - waiting for environments
  - environments not completely cleaned up
  - inability to determine whether problems were caused by errors in the code or something wrong with the environment
- Maxine going to Purna's desk to watch the work flow
- Roy the QA manager is very suspicious
- "... not just to do the right things, but to do the right things right"

#### Chapter 10
- code merge compared to writing a Hollywood script in isolation pg 156
- merge code once per day pg 157
  - "... small batch sizes, like in manufacturing, create a smooth flow of work ..."
- _**bad idea**_
    - "... if it hurts, do it less often ..." pg 159
- to make it hurt less you have to merge **more** frequently pg 158
- Jared the source code manager (SCM).
- "here at Parts Unlimited, doctors aren’t allowed to touch the patient. Well, except if there’s a P1 ticket open. But if the patient isn’t on the verge of death, like right now, apparently only Jared can touch the patient. And then Jared just does whatever the doctors tell him to, because, you know, doctors can’t touch the patient. Jared isn’t a doctor."
- " I think I know the real reason we aren’t allowed to push our changes … they don’t trust us. Doesn’t that bother you?! How can Jared know more about making changes than the developers who wrote them?"
- "This is the opposite of the Third Ideal, where instead of improving the processes we work within, we blindly follow them, she thinks. And now the process has fully imprisoned us, sucking out all the joy from our daily work, pushing us ever further away from the Second Ideal."
 
#### Chapter 11
- Contiunous intergration pg 181
- Continuous deployment pg 181

## Section 4: Chapters 13-16
### *Themes*
### *Key Takeaways*
### *Discussion Questions*
- How does the idea of Horizon 1, 2, 3 businesses apply to IT? 
  - Do we have Horizon 3 as R&D?
  - Horizon 2 as the growth technology?
  - Horizn 1 as tried and true legacy?
  
#### Chapter 13
- whitespace deployments pg 202
  - like "dark launches"
  - ie. adding a couple of blank lines to the end of HTML or config files
  - in theory this wouldn't change functionality in any way
- deployment of DataHub into production
- questions to ask when trouble shooting with a team pg 203
  - "Good hypothesis, Brent. What are you thinking?"
  - "How can we test your idea?"

  - inputs:
    - production telemetry
    - logs
    - chat rooms

  2. Discuss issues that occurred
  3. List actions to fix
- Promotions team meeting
  - customer personas pg 212-213
- Working in the business example - Maxine working at a store
  - observing processes

#### Chapter 14
- "This is not a story about small beating large; it’s fast beats slow."
- Second Town Hall meeting
- Meeting to go all in on NoSQL
>> The most difficult part was not the mechanics of importing the data from twenty different business systems. Instead, it was trying to create a unified vocabulary and taxonomy that they could use, because almost every business system had different names for similar things.
>>
>> Physical stores have five different definitions of in-store sales, including from a company acquired decades ago. There are six different ways that products are catalogued. Product categories and prices don’t line up. The business rules around pricing and promotion are exercises in forensic archaeology. They pulled in business analysts from across the company to help make sense of it and make decisions about how they should be represented.
- Demo Day
- " the queries the data scientists are building are a complete mismatch to what they’ve built Narwhal for. Narwhal is stellar at handling API requests from all the various teams across the company, but now they’re learning that it’s spectacularly not great for what the Analytics teams need to do."

<ul>

<li>

#### " It takes the Data Warehouse team four months to get twenty lines of SQL from Dev to QA to Production. And every time they do, reports break or show incorrect data."

</ul>

- Apache Spark style big data and compute platform
- 2004 Google Map/Reduce research paper

#### Chapter 15
- one percent test of marketing campaign
- pushing out a oneline fix 1hr before major deployment
- use of telemetry
  - monitoring order funnel
- “Thundering herd problem,” Wes mutters, referring to when simultaneous client retries end up killing a server. “We can’t do anything on the back end. How do we get all the clients to back off on the retries?”
“We can’t change the mobile apps, but we can get the e-commerce servers to wait longer before they retry,”
- Black Friday launch
  - API call to USPS address shipping causing crash. no service too small

#### Chapter 16
### **Key Takeaways:**

- **Metrics Emphasis:** Prioritization of employee engagement and customer satisfaction as crucial metrics for business success.

- **Horizons Model:**
  - *Horizon 1 (Cash Cow):* Current state with established models.
  - *Horizon 2 (Future Growth):* Represents the future and transitions at $100 million revenue.
  - *Horizon 3 (Learning Velocity):* Focus on exploration, prototyping, and risk assessment.

- **Conflict Management:** Caution against unchecked resource consumption by Horizon 1, advocating for the protection of Horizons 2 and 3 for sustained growth.

### **Themes:**

1. **Strategic Business Development:** Emphasis on exploring and validating business ideas, transitioning between different business horizons, and managing conflicts between short-term profitability and long-term growth.

2. **Market Dynamics:** Insights into the competitive advantage of being the first to market, along with statistics on revenue capture based on market entry timing.

3. **Software-Centric Approach:** Recognition of the pervasive role of software in modern business, underscoring the need to enhance developer productivity as a critical component of strategic business investments.
   
### *Discussion Questions*
- Can you identify any "Horizon 1, 2, or 3" projects or business areas at CNO?
- 

### Discussion
- redshirts breifing the bridge crew
- two most important metrics, employee engagement and customer satisfaction
- "more teams to explore the most promising business ideas, to find the next winner"
- one out of every three strategic ideas has a positive result, and only a third actually move the needle in a material way
- "We need a group that is dedicated and empowered to explore a broad range of business ideas that take advantage of our unique position in the marketplace, to quickly make bets, and then explore and validate them"
- Horizon 1, 2, and 3 businesses
  - Horizon 1 = cash cow
    - the customer, business, and operational models are well-known and predictable
  - Horizon 2 = represent the future of the company
    - may introduce the company’s capabilities to new customers, adjacent markets, or with different business models
    - may not be profitable, but this is where we find higher-growth areas.     - become the next generation of Horizon 1 businesses
    - this transition happens when your Horizon 2 business revenue hits $100 million.
    - come from Horizon 3
  - Horizon 3 = focus is on velocity of learning and having a broad pool of ideas to explore
    - name of the game is to prototype ideas and to answer as quickly as possible the three questions of market risk, technical risk, and business model risk: Does the idea solve a real customer need? Is it technically feasible? And is there a financially feasible engine of growth? 
    - If the answer is no to any of them, it’s time to pivot or kill the idea.
    - If the answer is yes, then the idea is continually developed until it earns the right to graduate to Horizon 2, where the business builders take over
  - Horizon 1 and Horizon 3 are often in conflict with each other
  - "Left unchecked, Horizon 1 leaders will consume all the resources of the company. They will note correctly that they are the lifeblood of the company, but that’s only true in the short term. There is an instinct to maximize profitability and take cash out of the business instead of reinvesting it. This is the ‘manage to value’ thesis and is the opposite of ‘manage to growth.’ If you want growth, Steve, you must protect Horizons 2 and 3, and any learnings generated there must be spread throughout the company."

- "If you’re first to market, you will capture fifty percent of the revenue that the entire product category will ever yield. Second place will capture twenty-five percent, and third place will get fifteen percent. For any later entrants, it will surely have been a complete waste of time and money"
- Almost all business investment now involves software. Means we must elevate developer productivity

# Book Study: The Phoenix Project

## Section 5: Chapters 17-20
### *Themes*
### *Key Takeaways*
### *Discussion Questions*

#### Chapter 17
- Project thinking vs. product thinking
- Refactoring legacy code using tests to isolate and then work through the issues
  - Hoare principle: “There are two ways to write code: write code so simple there are obviously no bugs in it, or write code so complex that there are no obvious bugs in it.”
- The opposite of technical debt. If they could make developers a little more productive all the time, it would always pay off in spades.
- An internal platform that they must manage like a product, not just as a project. It’s never done, if they want to keep their customers happy.
- This type of work seems so low-value, especially when compared to the opportunity cost of the work they should be doing, which is figuring out how to blaze the digital future... Their job was to build code, not muck with the actual hardware that the code runs on.
- Core vs Context
  - “Cores are the central competencies of the organization. These are things that customers are willing to pay for and what investors reward” 
  - “Context is everything else. It’s the cafeterias, shuttles between buildings, and the thousands of things companies must do to operate. They’re often mission-critical, such as HR, payroll, and email. But our customers do not pay us for the great payroll services we provide to our employees.
  - Clay Christiansen once stated, one keeps what is ‘not good enough’ and outsources what is ‘more than good enough,’
  - Chief Power Officer
    - “A hundred years ago, most large factories had a CPO—a chief power officer—who ran the electricity generation processes. It was one of the most important roles in manufacturing, because no electricity, no production. It was a Core process,” he says. “But that role has disappeared entirely. Electricity has become infrastructure that you buy from a utility company. It is interchangeable, and you choose suppliers primarily on price. There is rarely a competitive advantage to generating your own power. It is now merely Context, no longer Core. You don’t want to be the organization that has a large staff providing internal power generation.
